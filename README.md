# Missing App

_Multiplatform application to post lost and found things, pets, and people._

## Motivation

I wanted to create a more professional application than my previous projects. I already had experience with Flutter Framework, hence I decided to use it for this particular project.

## What I learned

I developed more in depth my skill with Flutter framework and in the making of beautiful user interfaces. Furthermore, I documented myself about the pros and cons of immutability while I was learning about Redux pattern, which later I decided to implement it to manage the global state of the application.

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

Below I mention several tools I used to develop this app:

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Google‚Äôs UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase
* [built_value](https://pub.dev/packages/built_value) - Dart package that provides immutable types and JSON serialization.
* [Redux](https://pub.dev/packages/redux) - Dart package to use Redux pattern in Dart.
